# YoutubeVideoAnalyser

The goal of this project is to retrieve comments from a given YouTube video and analyse the sentiment/thoughs of the audience - for example, simply by creating a word cloud from all the comments or attempt to use unsupervised learning such as (k-means) clustering to group comments that have similar sentiment.

The motivation behind this is that in almost every video posted by content creators on YouTube, they ask for opinions from their audience about what they think about the topic they spoke in their video. It's difficult for the authors to go through every single comment, so this approach might help them.
